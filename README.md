# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023

## Semantic versioning :mage: 

This project is going to utilize semantic versioning for its tagging. See: [semver.org](https://semver.org/).

The general format is as follows;
**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, e.g. `1.0.1`, where:
- **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when you make backward compatible bug fixes

## Install the Terraform CLI

### Consideridations with the Terraform CLI changes

The Terraform CLI installations instructions have changed due to pgp keyring changes. So we needed refer to the latest install CLI instructions (TF documentation and change) the scripting for the install. 

See: [Install Terraform CLI](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli).

### Considerations for Linux distribution

This project is a build against Ubuntu. Please consider checking your Linux distribution and change accordingly to your distribution needs. See: [How to check OS version of Linux](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/how-to-check-os-version-in-linux-command-line/).

_Example of checking the OS version_

**Command:**
```
$ cat /etc/os-release
```

**Output:**
```
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS"
NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION_ID="22.04"
VERSION="22.04.3 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)"
VERSION_CODENAME=jammy
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"
UBUNTU_CODENAME=jammy
```

### Refactoring into bash scripts

While fixing the TF gpg deprecation issues, we noticed the bash scripts steps were a considerable amount of new code. So we decided to create a bash script to install the TF CLI. 

This bash script is located here: [./bin/install_terraform_cli](./bin/install_terraform_cli).

- This will keep the Gitpod Task File ([.gitpod.yml](.gitpod.yml)) tidy.
- This will allow for an easier way to debug and execute manually  the TF CLI install
- This will allow better portability for other projects that need to install the TF CLI

### Shebang considerations

A Shebang (pronounched Sha-bang) tells the bash script what program will interpret the script, e.g. `#!/bin/bash`.

For portability for different OS distributions - the following command will search the user's PATH for the bash executable; `#!/usr/bin/env bash`.

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)

#### Execution considerations

When executing the bash script we can use the `./` short-hand notation to execute the bash script.

e.g. `./bin/install_terraform_cli`. If we are using a script in `.gitpod.yml` we need to point the script to a program to interpret it

#### Linux permissions considerations

In order to make our bash scripts executable we need to change the Linux permission for the fix to be executable at the user mode

```sh
chmod u+x ./bin/install/terraform_cli
```

See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod

### GitHub lifecycle (before, init, command)

We need to be careful when using the `init` because it will not rerun if we restart an existing workspace

See: https://www.gitpod.io/docs/configure/workspaces/tasks

### Working with env vars

We can list out all environment variables (env vars) using the `env` command
We can filter specific env vars using grep, e.g. `env | grep AWS_`

### Setting and unsetting env vars

- In the terminal we can set using `export HELLO='world'`
- In the terminal we unset using `unset HELLO`
- We can set an env var temporarily when just running a command

```sh
HELLO='world ./bin/print_message
```

Within in a bash script we can set an env var without writing export e.g.

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

HELLO='world'

echo $HELLO
```

#### Printing env vars

We can print an env var using echo, e.g. `echo $HELLO`

#### Scoping of env vars

When you open new bash terminal in VSCode it will not be aware of env vars that you have set in another tab/window. If you want env vars to persist across all future bash terminal that are open you need to set env vars in your bash profile, e.g. `.bash_profile`.

#### Persisting env vars in Gitpod

We can persist env var into Gitopod by storing them in Gitpod Secrets Storage

```
gp env HELLO='world'
```

All future workspaces launched will set the env vars for all bash terminals opened in those workspaces.

You can also set env vars in the `.gitpod.yml`, but this can only contain non-sensitive  env vars.
